If you want to translate to an unsupported language, you can translate the UI elements.

## Create an `i18n` file

To do so, you have to create the `i18n` diretory inside the root of the site, the directory where you can find the `config.yaml` file, and directories like `data`, `content`, etc.

Afterwards, you can create the file `<language_code>.toml` into the `i18n` directory. In this [directory](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/tree/gh-pages/flags/1x1), you can find all language codes with the flag that will appear with that code.

## Translate the UI elements

Inside the new file, just copy the following content, and replace the content between the quotation marks with the name in your desired language.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
If the content below gets obsolete, you can copy the contents from the [en](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha/blob/main/i18n/en.toml) file.
{{< /alert >}}
