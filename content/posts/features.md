This theme has been designed from a personal point of preference. As a developer, I want to organize my portfolio in a way that will reflect my skills best. So, this theme may or may not meet your needs but I will be happy to have your feedback.

This post will give you an overview of the features that this theme incorporates.

### Minimalist Design

This theme has been designed to be minimalist and beautiful. The color scheme has been chosen to be simple but yet powerful. The post page has been designed to be as distraction-free as possible. Thanks to [Anup Deb](https://dribbble.com/anupdeb) for his design guidance.

### Carefully Designed Cards

The skill and project cards are designed carefully to give more meaningful information. The skill cards not only just list your skills. It also gives the viewer an idea about your depth of knowledge of the particular skill. The project cards give an idea about the popularity of your project if it is an open-source project on Github.
