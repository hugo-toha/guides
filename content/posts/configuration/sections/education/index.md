The `Education` section is designed to showcase your academic background. In this post, we will guide you on how to configure the `Education` section of your site. For a complete reference, you can refer to the sample [education.yaml](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/blob/main/data/en/sections/education.yaml) file.

### Add Section Information

Add the following section metadata to your `education.yaml` file:

  enable: true
  weight: 4
  showOnNavbar: true
  # Can optionally hide the title in sections
  # hideTitle: true
```
