The `Education` section is designed to showcase your academic background. In this post, we will guide you on how to configure the `Education` section of your site. For a complete reference, you can refer to the sample [education.yaml](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/blob/main/data/en/sections/education.yaml) file.
