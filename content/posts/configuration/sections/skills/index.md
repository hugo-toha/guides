The `Skills` section should give the viewer an idea about not only the list of skills you have but also an idea of the depth of your knowledge on a particular skill. In this post, we are going to configure the `Skills` section of your site.

At first, create `skills.yaml` files in the `data` directory of your site. Then, follow the following instruction.

### Add Your Skills

Now, let's add a `skills` section in your `skills.yaml` file as bellow,

```yaml
skills:
- name: Kubernetes
  icon: "images/skills/kubernetes.png"
  summary: "Capable of deploying, managing application on Kubernetes. Experienced in writing Kubernetes controllers for CRDs."
```

Here, you have to provide `name`, `icon`, and `summary` fields for a skill. The `summary` field should provide an idea about your depth of knowledge of this particular skill.

>You can use markdown syntax in the `summary` field.

The following image shows how the content of `skills.yaml` files are mapped into the `Skills` section.
