The purpose of the `Projects` section is to effectively showcase your projects. In this post, we will guide you on how to configure the `Projects` section on your site. For a complete reference, please refer to the sample [projects.yaml](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/blob/main/data/en/sections/projects.yaml) file.

To begin, create a new file named `projects.yaml` in the `data/en/sections` directory of your website. Then, follow the instructions below.

### Add Section Information

Add the following section metadata to your `projects.yaml` file:

```yaml
# section information
section:
  name: Projects
  id: projects
  enable: true
  weight: 5
  showOnNavbar: true
  # Can optionally hide the title in sections
  # hideTitle: true
```

### Add Project Filtering Buttons

Now, add a `buttons` section in your `projects.yaml` file as bellow,

```yaml
buttons:
- name: All
  filter: "all"
- name: Professional
  filter: "professional"
- name: Academic
  filter: "academic"
- name: Hobby
  filter: "hobby"
```

Each button has two properties. The first property is `name` which is the text that will be displayed on the button and the other is `filter` which specifies the category of the projects this button should select.

A button will show only those projects that have a tag that matches the text specified in the `filter` filed. The filter value `all` is treated specially. It matches all the projects even though they don't have `all` as a tag in their `tags` field.

### Add Your Projects

Now, add your projects under the `projects` section of your `projects.yaml` file as bellow,

```yaml
projects:
- name: Kubernetes
  logo: images/projects/kubernetes.png
  role: Contributor
  timeline: "March 2018 - Present"
  repo: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
  # url: ""
  summary: Production-Grade Container Scheduling and Management .
  tags: ["professional", "kubernetes", "cloud"]
```

You can specify the following field for a project,

- **name**: The name of the project.
- **logo**: The logo of the project. If the project does not have a logo, the theme will automatically add a placeholder there.
- **role**: Your role in the project.
- **timeline**: The timeline when you have worked on the project.
- **repo**: If the project is an open-source project and hosted on Github, you can provide the repository URL. This will be used to show the star count for the project.
- **url**: If the project is not an open-source project or not hosted on Github, you can provide an URL of the project. This will create a button with the link in the project card.
- **summary**: A short description of your project.
- **tags**: A list of tags for your project. It will be used to select the project under a category by the filtering buttons.

>You can use markdown syntax in the `summary` field.
