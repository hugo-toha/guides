The purpose of the `About` section is to provide a brief introduction about yourself on your website. In this post, we will guide you on how to configure the `About` section. For a complete reference, please check out the sample [about.yaml](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/blob/main/data/en/sections/about.yaml) file.

To get started, create an `about.yaml` file in the `data/en/sections` directory of your website. Then, follow the instructions below.

### Add Section information

```yaml
section:
  name: About # Title of section (default: "")
  id: about # url id/slug of section *Required*
  enable: true # Boolean to determine if this section is enabled (default: false)
  weight: 1 # Order to display section in (default: alphabetical followed by weight)
  showOnNavbar: true # Boolean to determine if a link should be shown for this section on the navbar
  template: sections/about.html # allows you to point to a specific template.
```

#### Template setting

You have the option to customize the partial used for this section by specifying the `template` property. Simply save the new template in your `layout/partials` directory.

### Add Your Work Information

To include details about your current job, you can add the following section to your `about.yaml` file:

```yaml
# your designation
designation: Software Engineer
# your company information
company:
  name: Example Co.
  url: "https://www.example.com"
```

### Add a Summary About Yourself

To provide a concise overview of your professional expertise, let's add a summary section. This will give viewers a quick glimpse into what you do. Add the following section to your `about.yaml` file:

```yaml
# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a passionate software engineer with x years of working experience. I built OSS tools for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using GO. My tools help people to deploy their workloads in Kubernetes. Sometimes, I work on some fun projects such as writing a theme, etc.'
```

Try to make it as brief as possible. Don't make it too wordy. We have other sections that give more insight into your expertise.

>You can use markdown syntax in the `summary` field.

### Add Your Social Links

To add links to your various profiles such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Github, include the following `socialLinks` section in your `about.yaml` file:

```yaml
# your social links
# give as many as you want. use font-awesome for the icons.
socialLinks:
- name: Email
  icon: "fas fa-envelope"
  url: "example@gmail.com"

- name: Github
  icon: "fab fa-github"
  url: "https://www.github.com/example"

- name: Stackoverflow
  icon: "fab fa-stack-overflow"
  url: "#"

- name: LinkedIn
  icon: "fab fa-linkedin"
  url: "#"

- name: Twitter
  icon: "fab fa-twitter"
  url: "#"

- name: Facebook
  icon: "fab fa-facebook"
  url: "#"
```

You can use any [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) free icons in the icon field.

### Add a Resume

To add your resume, place the PDF file in `files` folder within the `static` directory. Then, include the following section in your `about.yaml` file:

```yaml
# your resume. this file path should be relative to you "static" directory
resourceLinks:
- title: "My Resume"
  url: "files/resume.pdf"
```

### Add badges

Now, let's add your badges and a strength indicator for various soft skills such as leadership, communication, teamwork, etc. Include the following section in your `about.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Show your badges
# You can show your verifiable certificates from https://www.credly.com.
# You can also show a circular bar indicating the level of expertise on a certain skill
badges:
- type: certification
  name: Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist
  url: "https://www.credly.com/org/the-linux-foundation/badge/exam-developer-certified-kubernetes-security-specialist"
  badge: "https://images.credly.com/size/680x680/images/f4bf92ed-8985-40b2-bc07-2f9308780854/kubernetes-security-specialist-logo-examdev.png"
