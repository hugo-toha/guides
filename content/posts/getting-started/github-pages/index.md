In this post, we are going to deploy the site we have created in previous post in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). At first, make sure that your repository name is `<your username>.github.io`. Then, commit any local uncommitted changes and push into Github.


#### Create `gh-pages` Branch

At first, create a new branch named `gh-pages`. Github will automatically set respective configurations for Github Pages when it see a branch with this name.

```bash
# create the gh-pages branch
$ git checkout -b gh-pages
# push the source branch into Github
$ git push gh-pages gh-pages
```

#### Enable Github Action

We are going to automate the deploying process using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). At first, make sure that Github Action is enabled in your repository. Go to `Settings > Actions` of your repository and make sure `Action permissions` is set to `Allow all actions`. Here, is a screenshot of the respective setting:

#### Add Workflow

We are going to use [peaceiris/actions-hugo](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo) action to set up hugo and [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) to deploy the site. Create `.github` folder at the root of your repository. Then, create `workflows` folder inside the `.github` folder. Finally, create a `deploy-site.yaml` file inside the `workflows` folder and add the following content there:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Github Pages

# run when a commit is pushed to "source" branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    # checkout to the commit that has been pushed
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup Hugo
      uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v3
      with:
        hugo-version: 'latest'
        extended: true

    - name: Update Hugo Modules
      run: hugo mod tidy

    - name: Setup Node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20

    - name: Install node modules
      run: |
        hugo mod npm pack
        npm install

    - name: Build
      run: hugo --minify

    # push the generated content into the `gh-pages` branch.
    - name: Deploy
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_branch: gh-pages
        publish_dir: ./public
```

This action will start on every push into the `main` branch. It will build the site and commit the generated content into `gh-pages` branch.

#### Deploy

If you have followed the guide properly, your site should be ready to deploy in Github Pages. Now, if you push any commit into your `main` branch, a Github Action will start and deploy your site automatically.

Push a commit into the `main` branch and go to `Actions` tab of your repository to verify that the action has started.

Now, wait for the actions to complete. If it completes successfully, you should see a green tick indicating successful run.

Once the Github Action has completed successfully, you can browse your site at `https://<your username>.github.io`.

#### Add custom domain name

If you own a domain name and willing to use it in this website go to your domain name provider website. Then add the following Resource Records:
```
@      3600    IN A     185.199.108.153
@      3600    IN A     185.199.109.153
@      3600    IN A     185.199.110.153
@      3600    IN A     185.199.111.153

WWW    3600    IN A     185.199.108.153
WWW    3600    IN A     185.199.109.153
WWW    3600    IN A     185.199.110.153
WWW    3600    IN A     185.199.111.153
```

To verify your domain to make sure nobody from Github can claim it except from you, you can follow the steps contained in [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages).

Finally create a `CNAME` file inside `/static` directory of your repository. Add your domain name there:

```
example.com
```
Once the Github Action has completed successfully, you can browse your site at `https://<your domain name>`.

Note that by browsing to `https://<your username>.github.io` it will automaitcally redirect to `https://<your domain name>`.
