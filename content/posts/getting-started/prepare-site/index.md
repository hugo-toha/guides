{{< /alert >}}

In this post, we are going to create a hugo site from scratch. Then, we will configure it with `Toha` theme, make it multilingual, add some example posts. At the end of this post, you should be able to run a fully functional hugo site with `Toha` theme locally.

If you want a head start, you can just fork [hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io) repo, rename it and update with your own data. This repo has already been configured to deploy in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

If you already have a hugo site, skip to the [Add Theme](#add-theme) section.

### Create Repository

At first, create a repository in Github. If you want to deploy this site in Github Pages, your repo named should be `<your user name>.github.io`. Clone the repository into your local machine and navigate into it.

### Create Site

Now, make sure that you have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) installed. This theme should work with hugo version `v0.68.0` and later. Now, run the following command in the root of your repository to initiate a hugo website.

```console
$ hugo new site ./ -f=yaml --force
```

This command will create a basic hugo site structure. Here, `-f=yaml` flag tells hugo to create configuration file in YAML format and `--force` flag forces hugo to create a site even if the target directory is not empty.

### Initialize the git repository

Now,it is time to add a git to your website. Initialize the git repository using the following command:

```
$ git init
```

### Add Theme

Now, it is time to add a theme into your site. Add Toha theme as git sub-module of your repository using the following command:

```console
$ git submodule add https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha.git themes/toha
```

{{< vs 1 >}}

>Don't use SSH URL of the theme during adding it as git sub-module. Also, don't clone the theme in your `themes` directory using `git clone`. Otherwise, we won't be able to automate the site publishing using Github Action or Netlify.

### Run Site Locally

Now, you can already run your site locally. Let's run the site in watch mode using the following command:

```console
$ hugo server -t toha -w
```
If you navigate to `http://localhost:1313`, you should see a basic site with Toha theme. In the next section, we are going to configure the site to look like the [hugo-toha.github.io](https://hugo-toha.github.io/). As we have run the server in watch mode, any changes we make to the site will be instantly visible in the browser.

### Configure Site

Now, we are ready to configure our site. In this section, we are going to add  author information, different sections, and sample posts etc.

####  Update `config.yaml`

When you have created the site using `hugo new site` command, it has created a `config.yaml` file in the root of your repository. Replace the default content of the `config.yaml` file with the following:

```yaml
baseURL: https://hugo-toha.github.io

languageCode: en-us
title: "John's Blog"
theme: "toha"

# Manage languages
# For any more details, you can check the official documentation: https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/
languages:
  en:
    languageName: English
    weight: 1

# Control TOC depth
markup:
  tableOfContents:
    startLevel: 2
    endLevel: 6
    ordered: false

# Enable global emoji support
enableEmoji: true

# Site parameters
params:
  # GitHub repo URL of your site
  gitRepo: https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io

  # specify whether you want to write some blog posts or not
  enableBlogPost: true

  # specify whether you want to show Table of Contents in reading page
  enableTOC: true

  # Provide newsletter configuration. This feature hasn't been implemented yet.
  # Currently, you can just hide it from the footer.
  newsletter:
    enable: true
```

Here, you are seeing a basic configuration for Toha theme. You can see the configuration file used in the example site form [here](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/blob/source/config.yaml). For more detailed configuration options, please check [this post](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/configuration/site-parameters/).

#### Add Data

Most of the contents of this theme is driven by some YAML files in `data` directory. In this section, we are going to add some sample data. Since, we're building a multilingual site, we are going to keep the data for each language separate into their own locale folder.

At first, create `en` folder inside your `data` directory. We are going to add data for `English` language here.

##### Site Information

Now, create a `site.yaml` file inside `/data/en/` directory of your repository. Add the following content there:

```yaml
# Copyright Notice
copyright: Â© 2020 Copyright.

# Meta description for your site.  This will help the search engines to find your site.
description: Portfolio and personal blog of John Doe.
```
To see all the available options for site information, check [this sample file](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/blob/source/data/en/site.yaml).

##### Author Information

Now, create a `author.yaml` file in `/data/en/` directory and add your information there as below:

```yaml
# some information about you
name: "John Doe"
nickname: "John"
# greeting message before your name. it will default to "Hi! I am" if not provided
greeting: "Hi, I am"
image: "images/author/john.png"
# give your some contact information. they will be used in the footer
contactInfo:
  email: "johndoe@example.com"
  phone: "+0123456789"
  stack-overflow:
    icon: stack-overflow
    url: "https://stackoverflow.com/users/1/exampleUser"
    text: "ExampleUser"

# some summary about what you do
summary:
  - I am a Developer
  - I am a Devops
  - I love servers
  - I work on open-source projects
  - I love to work with some fun projects
```

##### Add Sections

Now, we are going to add different sections into our home page. At first, create a `sections` folder inside your `/data/en` directory. Here, we are going to add few sections with minimum configurations. In order to see detailed configuration options for the sections, please visit [here](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/configuration/sections/).

###### About Section

Create `about.yaml` file inside your `/data/en/sections/` directory. Then add the following contents there:

softSkills:

- At first, create a `posts` folder inside `content` directory of your site.
- Then, create `_index.md` file inside the `posts` directory. Copy the content of [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/source/content/posts/_index.md) file and paste into the newly created `_index.md` file.
- Create `introduction` folder inside your `posts` directory.
- Add the following [hero.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/source/content/posts/introduction/hero.svg) inside your `introduction` folder.
- Now, create `index.md` file inside the `introduction` folder. This `index.md` file will hold the post contents.
- Add the following [sample contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/source/content/posts/introduction/index.md) in the newly created `index.md` file.

Now, your post should appear at `http://localhost:1313/posts` and your `Recent Posts` section also should show this post card. For translating a post, just create a new file with name `index.<language code>.md` in the same directory. Then, add the translated content there.
